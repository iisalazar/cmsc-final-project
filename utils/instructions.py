Splitwise is an app for dividing expenses 
with your friends. It allows you and your 
friends to input multiple bills and keep 
track of who owes who, and then it assists 
you in settling up with each other. Here's 
a basic rundown of how it works.

âž¢ Firstly, add friends into your list by
  going to the FRIENDS SECTION.

âž¢ To add an expense with your friends, go
  to EXPENSES SECTION. You may add an
  expense with your friend only or with
  your group.

âž¢ Should you want to manage expenses by
  more than 1 friend, proceed to GROUPS
  SECTION. Add a group and assign your
  friends to that group.

âž¢ Navigate to PAYMENT SECTION to settle
  balances with your friend or your group.

âž¢ Want to check the progress of every
  balance? Go to REPORTS SECTIONS to see
  the updated version of your transaction
  within your friend or your group.

And you're done! You are now ready to use
this application. Have fun splitting!~
